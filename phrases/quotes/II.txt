Good evening. May I help you?
Oh, my... oh, my! Master Anakin! My goodness, I can hardly believe it! And this must be Miss Padme.
Oh, dear! I'm so terribly sorry, Master Annie.
I think we'd better go inside.
Master Lars - Master Owen! Somebody to see you!
Please don't leave us, Miss Padme. These people need your help.
That's something I cannot relate to. As a Protocol Droid, I'm either active or inactive. There's no in-between.
Do you really think so..? I suppose I shouldn't expect...
Oh, I'm not unhappy... and my masters here ar so kind I wouldn't wish to trouuble them, it's just... being like this... well, it's embarrassing.
Naked. If you pardon the expression. You see, when Master Annie made me, he never quite found the time to give me any outer covering. It's so humiliating. How would you like it if you had to go around with all your circuits showing?
Of course you wouldn't. Nobody would. It's simply not protocol.
I don't think so. Only Master Annie...
Oh? How observant of you, Miss Padme. Of course, I'm just not mechanically minded... if you see what I mean.
Ooooh! That's tickles.
Um. How do I look?
Perfect? Oh, Miss Padme, I'm so happy! Oh, pardon me.
Thank you.
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
Oh, my!
Yes, it is, Artoo. Most confusing. One moment they're generating a pleasant mutual attraction and the next, waves of violent hostility. Even though I'm programmed to understand them, I doubt if I ever shall.
Yes, it has been rather a long time. Do you suppose something's happened to them?
Danger? Oh no, I shouldn't think so. It looks a very dull planet to me. They should be back shortly. Just stop worrying, Artoo.
I don't hear anything. You're scaring me! Stop imagining things!
I'm sure I heard something, this time. Didn't you? It's probably just a celebration
