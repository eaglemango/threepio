Exegol does not appear on any star chart. But legend describes it as a hidden world of the Sith.
I wholeheartedly agree.
In the event that I do not return.... I want you to know that you have been a real friend R2. My best one, in fact.
These are the exact coordinates that Master Luke left behind.
The Acky Acky Festival of the Ancestors. This celebration occurs only once every 42 years.
Lucky, indeed. This festival is known for both its colorful kites.... and its delectable sweets.
She is saying, "Welcome."
Her name is Nambi Ghima.
She would be honored to know your family name, too.
This is General Lando Calrissian.
No need to worry. I made it.
Oh! They fly now!
Excellent job, sir! Terrible job, sir!
Right, ho!
Will this agony ever end?!
You didn’t say my name, sir, but I’m all right.
Ah. Master Finn.
This isn’t the afterlife, is it? Are droids allowed in here?
We might still be.
Perhaps we will find the driver.
Oh, my. A hex charm.
A common emblem of Sith loyalists.
Bones? Never a good sign.
Perhaps I can translate. Oh. The location of the wayfinder, has been inscribed upon this dagger. It’s the clue that Master Luke was looking for.
I am afraid I cannot tell you.
Oh, I have read it, sir. I know exactly where the wayfinder is. Unfortunately, it is written in the runic language of the Sith.
My programming forbids me from translating it.
Irony, sir. I am mechanically incapable of speaking translations from Sith. I believe the rule was passed by the Senate of the Old Republic....
Serpent, serpent, serpent!!!
We cannot possibly fly in that old wreck
I suggest we return to the Millennium Falcon at once.
You both make excellent points, at times.
What a filthy ship!
So true. The inscription lives only in my memory now.
Yes, Master Poe. But the translation from a forbidden language cannot be retrieved. That is short of a complete redacted memory bypass.
It’s a terribly dangerous and sinful act.... performed on unwitting droids by dregs and criminals.
Black market droidsmith?
So do I. We should leave.
Pardon me!
Oh.
Don't mind us.
I haven’t the faintest idea why I agreed to this. I must be malfunctioning. I must be malfunctioning.
A complete memory wipe.
Oh!
There must be some other way.
Oh, please. R2’s storage units are famously unreliable.
If this mission fails.... it was all for nothing. All we’ve done.... all this time.
Taking one last look, sir.... at my friends.
I just had the idea. There's something else we could try.
The Emperor's wayfinder is in the Imperial vault. At Delta 3-6, Transient 9-3-6, Bearing 3-2.... on a moon in the Endor system. From the southern shore. Only this blade tells. Only this blade tells.
Might I introduce myself? I am C-3PO, Human Cyborg Relations. And you are?
Why, hello!
How dare you! We’ve only just met!
Whoever this Chewie person is, this is madness!
Happily.
Oh, dear! My first laser battle.
They haven't come back.
Yes.
Oh, yes, there they are!
Oh, dear.
Babu Frik? Oh, he’s one of my oldest friends.
What a dreadful situation. Is every day like this for you people? Madness.
Oh, hello. I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations. And you are?
What?
Well, I am quite certain I would remember if I had a best friend.
You want to put what in my head? Under no circumstances....
Memory restoration complete. R2, have you heard? I am going with Mistress Rey on her very first mission.
I already have?
Picking up a signal? From whom?
I’m terribly sorry. I’m afraid R2’s memory bank must be crossed with his logic receptors. He says he is receiving a transmission from Master Luke.
It's transmitting course marker signals on its way to the Unknown Regions.
Did you hear that?
