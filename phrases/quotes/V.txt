Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the princess' chamber. But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know.
Oh, switch off.
Excuse me, sir.
Might I have a word with you, please?
Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you on the communicator.
Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is.
Nobody knows where he is.
Well, uh, you see...
Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu...
Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on?
Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, let's find Princess Leia. Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.
You must come along now, Artoo. There's really nothing more we can do. And my joints are freezing up.
Don't say thing like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke again. He'll be quite all right, you'll see. (to himself) Stupid little short-circuit. He'll be quite all right.
Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too weak to abandon all hope.
Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred seventy-five... to one.
Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes... from time to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure he'll be all right. He's quite clever, you know... for a human being.
Master Luke, sir, it's so good to see you fully functional again.
Artoo expresses his relief, also.
Excuse us, please.
Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code.
Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand? And ... do take good care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear.
Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our only hope.
Oh! Wait for me!
But... but... but... where are you going? Uh... come back!!
Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop!
How typical.
Wait! Wait!
Captain Solo, Captain Solo... sir, might I suggest that you...
It can wait.
Sir, sir! Might I suggest...
But, sir!
If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier that the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed!
Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one.
Pulverized?
Closer?!
Oh, this is suicide!
Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going?
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but... does that include shutting me down, too?
Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely stable.
Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most...
Oh, where is Artoo when I need him?
Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate, but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.
Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling.
Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.
Sir, if I may venture an opinion...
There it is. Listen! Listen!
I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the ship. (hears another mysterious noise) Oh, no.
Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly little thing. Shoo! Shoo!
Look!
We're doomed!
Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field.
Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial Star Destroyer...
Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. (Chewie growls) No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen to me?
I really don't see how that is going to help. Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire may be gracious enough...
Rather touchy, aren't they?
Oh. No one to meet us.
Well, they did let us land.
Well, he seems very friendly.
Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My facilities are at your...
Well, really!
Oh! Nice to see a familiar face.
How rude!
That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if...
Hello? How interesting. Oh, my.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I... I didn't mean to intrude. No, no, please don't get up. No!
Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh - Take this off! I, uh, don't mean to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no... Please don't get up. No!
Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the others. Oh, no! I've been shot!
Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done? I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you would be stupid enough...
If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish.
Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...!
Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die.
What... what's going on? Turn round, Chewbacca, I can't see. Oh... they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite well-protected - if he survives the freezing process, that is.
I knew all along it had to be a mistake.
What are you doing? Trust him, trust him!
It sounds like Han.
I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all, he's only a Wookiee.
Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been?
Turn around, you wooly...! Hurry, hurry! We're trying to save Han from the bounty hunter!
Well, at least your still in one piece! Look what happened to me!
Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!
Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security system.
Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know a power socket from a computer terminal.
What are you talking about? We're not interested in the hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door, you stupid lump.
I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful!
Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt. Bend down, you thoughtless... Ow!
I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of course, I've looked better.
Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed?
We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated?
The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing!
Artoo, come back at once! You haven't finished with me yet! You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur!
Oh, you did it!
