Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place.
Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt, You'd probably short-circuit.
Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose.
There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master Luke.
Goodness gracious me!
Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du Hutt.
I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go.
Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should rush into all this.
Oh, Artoo! Artoo, wait for me!
Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no.
Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, Jabba the Hutt.
...and a gift. Gift, what gift?
He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself.
I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things.
Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this.
Good morning.
The message, Artoo, the message.
What did he say?
This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message.
We're doomed.
Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite.
What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
Oh. Well, yes.
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can readily...
Disintegrated?
Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!
Oh, no! Chewbacca!
Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!
Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-five thousand.
Uh, oh... but what, what did I say? Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand.
Because he's holding a thermal detonator.
Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.
He agrees!
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.
Master Luke, you're standing on...
Oh, no! The Rancor!
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?
Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too!
Hmm. I wish I had your confidence.
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.
Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!
Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.
Sounds dangerous.
"Exciting" is hardly the word I would use.
Here we go again.
Oh, I told you it was dangerous here.
Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!
Don't worry, Master Luke. We know what to do.
And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!
Oh, Master Luke.
I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.
Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-op!!
Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!
Oh, yes, Master Luke! Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication.
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect. But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor.
Your Royal Highness.
But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly --
You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just...
...as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh!
Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh!
Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.
I... I never knew I had it in me.
Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.
Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.
He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield generator.
He says there's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge.
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
I have decided that we shall stay here.
Oh, my! They'll be captured!
Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me.
Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me?
Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea?
We surrender.
Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo.
Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back!
We're coming!
Oh, Artoo, hurry!
My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave?
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?
Oh, dear.
They did it!
