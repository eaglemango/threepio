It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.
Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.
Is there anything I might do for you, my lady?
My Lady, are you. . . . Are you all right?
The Chancellor's office indicated Master Anakin returned to the Jedi Temple. Don't worry, My Lady. I am sure he will be all right.
My Lady, there's a Jedi fighter docking on the veranda.
Hush! Not so loud!
What is going on?
You can't be anymore confused than I am.
Something important is going on! I heard a rumor they are going to banish all droids.
Shhhhhh . . . not so loud.
Whatever it is, we'll be the last to know.
Well, he is under a lot of stress, Artoo.
Take care, my little friend.
My Lady, is there anything I might do?
A snack, perhaps?
I feel so helpless.
Hello, might I help you . . . Oh, it's you, Master Kenobi. Come in, quickly.
Yes . . . right after the attack on the Jedi Temple.
Oh, dear.
Green light. Do you know that I think I'm beginning to get the hang of this flying business.
What are you doing? You're going to hurt her. Wait!!
I am being careful. I've got a good hold on her, but . . . I'm worried about my back. I hope it's able to hold up under this weight.
Master Kenobi! We have Miss Padme on board. Please, please hurry. We should leave this dreadful place.
It s some kind of reproductive process, I think.
What? Oh, no.
