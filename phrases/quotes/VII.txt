Goodness! Han Solo! It is I, See- Threepio! You probably don't recognize me because of the red arm. Look who it is! Did you see who? Oh. Excuse me, Prin-- uh, General. Sorry. Come along, BB-8. Quickly.
General, I regret to inform you, but this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete. And even worse, it matches no charted system on record. We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke.
You're wasting your time.
It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data.
Oh my. Without the Republic fleet, we're doomed. They all react to this horrible news.
Thank the Maker!
And their weapon will be fully charged in 10 minutes! It would take a miracle to save us now.
R2-D2! You've come back! You found what? How dare you call me that!
Find Master Luke how? Come, R2! We must go tell the others at once!
General? Excuse me, General?
R2-D2 may contain some much needed good news.
Oh! The map! It is complete!
Oh my dear friend. How I've missed you.
